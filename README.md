# Fossil

Fossil is a distributed version control system that is built on top of the
SQLite database. It also has features like Wiki, Forum, Tickets and a fully
functional Web UI built into the single binary. This container image builds on
Alpine Linux and installs the Fossil package directly from the Alpine
repositories. The pre-built image is available from the Github Container
Registry.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ankitrgadiya/fossil:main
```
